Unlike Typst, we cannot do references with an at sign: @reference.

== Putting equals signs at the start of the line does not make this line into a heading.  

/ Unlike Typst, this line is plain text: and not a term and definition  

Similarly, math mode does not work: $ x = 5 $  

A backslash on its own does not produce a line break: a\b.  

Typst commands do not work: #rect(width: 1cm)  

Neither do Typst comments: /* A comment */ // Line comment  

Neither does tildes: foo~bar  

Neither do Unicode escapes: \u{1f600}
