    <p>Unlike Typst, we cannot do references with an at sign: @reference.</p>
    <p>== Putting equals signs at the start of the line does not make this line into a heading.</p>
    <p>/ Unlike Typst, this line is plain text: and not a term and definition</p>
    <p>Similarly, math mode does not work: $ x = 5 $</p>
    <p>A backslash on its own does not produce a line break: a\b.</p>
    <p>Typst commands do not work: #rect(width: 1cm)</p>
    <p>Neither do Typst comments: /* A comment */ // Line comment</p>
    <p>Neither does tildes: foo~bar</p>
    <p>Neither do Unicode escapes: \u{1f600}</p>
